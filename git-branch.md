#### Understanding the `Git branch` command

# When using Git, a `branch` can be thought of as simply a movable pointer.

When you begin making changes (commits) within a repository, you are provided with a "master" branch automatically which points to the last commit you made. Every time you perform a commit, this master branch moves forward. 

When a new branch is created (and given a suitable title) the user can then move the pointer, i.e. the HEAD, to the newly created branch, and this will provide the user with a new direction in which to take their workflow; seperate from the master. This new branch will now move forward with each commit.

The user can at any time switch back to the master branch to make changes, moving forward with each new commit from an older version of the repository,  as both sets of commits are isolated in separate branches.
